Apart from PHP, I can't recall any other language that has got so much criticism as Javascript has. Is that because the first version was designed in 10 days? Honestly, I don't know.
Every Javascript developer, be it on the client or server-side already
heard someone complain about Javascript being the worst language.
Usually it comes down to the fact that they never really tried the language.
It's one of the most expressive languages we have today, the most popular as well.
I've been using it for over 4 years now and there are some aspects that I really dislike.
Most of them probably due to browser backward compability, engines must support older versions too.

## Pros 


I always say that it's a very flexible language, you can create really complex mechanisms 
that help to solve a lot of complex problems. At the same time, it can be quite chalenging to
get it right at the first time. It demands a lot of discipline, use of best practices and diligence.

## Cons
### Type system
It's a weakly-typed language. I never understood the benefits. Who declares a variable and then reassigns it to a different type?

Fear no more, my son. Typescript to the rescue! I was pretty skeptical at the beggining, however I'm  currently using it for Angular and the integration with IDEs and the documentation it offers is simply amazing.
