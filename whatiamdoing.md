# What I am doing now

Inspired by Derek Sivers and Thomas Frank, I created this section as a reminder to myself of my priorities.

I am based in Prague, Czech Rep., I've been living here since May 2019.


This is how I'm spending my time:

* Working at [Kendaxa](kendaxa.com)
* Learning Czech
* Experimenting with waking up at 5:30am
* Reading [books](/books)
* Creating a web app to help me to learn new languagues [polyglot](google.com)
* Working out
