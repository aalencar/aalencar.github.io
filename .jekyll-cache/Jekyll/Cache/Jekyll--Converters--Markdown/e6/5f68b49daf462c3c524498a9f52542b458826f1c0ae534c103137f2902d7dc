I"˜<p>Apart from PHP, I canâ€™t recall any other language that has got so much criticism as Javascript has. Is that because the first version was designed in 10 days? Honestly, I donâ€™t know.
Every Javascript developer, be it on the client or server-side already
heard someone complain about Javascript being the worst language.
Usually it comes down to the fact that they never really tried the language.
Itâ€™s one of the most expressive languages we have today, the most popular as well.
Iâ€™ve been using it for over 4 years now and there are some aspects that I really dislike.
Most of them probably due to browser backward compability, engines must support older versions too.</p>

<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>

<p>I always say that itâ€™s a very flexible language, you can create really complex mechanisms 
that help to solve a lot of complex problems. At the same time, it can be quite chalenging to
get it right at the first time. It demands a lot of discipline, use of best practices and diligence.</p>

<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>
<h3 id="type-system">Type system</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s a weakly-typed language. I never understood the benefits. Who declares a variable and then reassigns it to a different type?</p>

<p>Fear no more, my son. Typescript to the rescue! I was pretty skeptical at the beggining, however Iâ€™m  currently using it for Angular and the integration with IDEs and the documentation it offers is simply amazing.</p>
