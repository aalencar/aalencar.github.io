I"­<p>Apart from PHP, I canâ€™t recall any other language that has got so much criticism as Javascript has. Is that because the first version was designed in 10 days? Honestly, I donâ€™t know.
Every Javascript developer, be it on the client or server-side already
heard someone complain about Javascript being the worst language.
Usually it comes down to the fact that they never really tried the language.
Itâ€™s one of the most expressive languages we have today, the most popular as well.
Iâ€™ve been using it for over 4 years now and there are some aspects that I really dislike.
Most of them probably due to browser backward compability, engines must support older versions too.</p>
