<p>Inspired by Derek Sivers and Thomas Frank, I created this section as a reminder to myself of my priorities.</p>

<p>I am based in Prague, Czech Rep., I’ve been living here since May 2019.</p>

<p>This is how I’m spending my time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Working at <a href="kendaxa.com">Kendaxa</a></li>
  <li>Learning Czech</li>
  <li>Experimenting with waking up at 5:30am</li>
  <li>Reading <a href="/books">books</a></li>
  <li>Creating a web app to help me to learn new languagues <a href="google.com">polyglot</a></li>
  <li>Working out</li>
</ul>
